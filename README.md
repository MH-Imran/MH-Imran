Hey, I'm Imran
I’m learning cybersecurity step by step and documenting everything here as I go.
Goal: Junior SOC Analyst (Blue Team / Tier 1).

Some days things click, some days I re-learn the same topic again - but I keep moving.

What I am focused on right now
Windows Event Logs: logon + auth failures + process creation (4624 / 4625 / 4688)
Wireshark basics: DNS → TCP handshake → TLS Client Hello (building a clean “normal baseline”)
MITRE ATT&CK: reading techniques slowly and mapping them to real log clues
Linux + networking fundamentals (LAN, DNS, DHCP, ARP) with notes I actually revisit
Featured repos (what I update the most)
TryHackMe Progress — room notes + small takeaways
https://github.com/MH-Imran/tryhackme-progress

MITRE ATT&CK Notes — techniques explained in my own words
https://github.com/MH-Imran/mitre-attack-notes

Linux & Networking Notes — commands, reminders, quick examples
https://github.com/MH-Imran/linux-and-networking-notes

Cybersecurity Journey — roadmap + weekly progress tracking
https://github.com/MH-Imran/cybersecurity-journey

Skills I'm building (one step at a time)
SOC / Blue Team fundamentals
Log analysis and basic investigation flow
SIEM concepts (learning the “why”, not just clicking alerts)
Linux and networking foundations
Python for small automation scripts
Lab setup (what I practice on)
Ubuntu (Virtual Machine)+Windows 10 (Virtual Machine)

Tools: Event Viewer, Sysinternals, Wireshark

Still learning. Still improving. Still moving forward.
