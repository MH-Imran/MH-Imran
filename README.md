# Hey, I'm Imran

I’m learning cybersecurity step by step and documenting everything here as I go.  
**Goal:** Junior SOC Analyst (Blue Team / Tier 1).

Some days things click and some days I re-learn the same topic again — but I keep moving.

---

## What I'm focused on right now
- Windows Event Logs: logon + auth failures + process creation (4624 / 4625 / 4688)
- Wireshark basics: DNS → TCP handshake → TLS Client Hello (building a clean “normal baseline”)
- MITRE ATT&CK: reading techniques slowly and mapping them to real log clues
- Linux + networking fundamentals (LAN, DNS, DHCP, ARP) with notes I actually revisit

---

---

## Skills I'm building (one step at a time)
- SOC / Blue Team fundamentals
- Log analysis and basic investigation flow
- SIEM concepts (learning the “why”, not just clicking alerts)
- Linux and networking foundations
- Python for small automation scripts

---

## Lab setup (what I practice on)
- Windows 10 VM + Ubuntu VM
- Tools: Event Viewer, Sysinternals, Wireshark

Still learning. Still improving. Still moving forward.
