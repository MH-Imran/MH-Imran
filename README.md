# 👋 Hey, I'm Imran

So… I'm basically figuring out cybersecurity step by step. Still kinda new to all this.  
This place (GitHub) is just where I throw my notes, stuff I’m learning, and whatever I’m trying to understand at the moment.  
Not really a polished profile or anything, just my learning trail.

Most of days I’m just trying to understand the basics properly. Some days it clicks, some days it doesn’t.  
But I guess that’s normal.

## 🔹 What I’m Learning (honestly, a bit of everything)

Right now I’m moving between a few things:

- Trying to understand SIEM tools and setting up small home labs. I break it a lot, then fix it, then break it again.
- Networking stuff like LAN, OSI, ARP, DNS, DHCP. I keep forgetting parts and then relearning them.
- Looking at logs and trying to figure out “why did this happen?” instead of just reading the alert.
- MITRE ATT&CK… honestly it’s big, so I’m reading it slowly.
- Linux commands. Some make sense, some don’t… still learning.
- Doing TryHackMe rooms and writing short notes so future-me doesn’t forget everything.

Nothing perfectly organized, but I’m moving forward.

## 🔹 Repos I Update Often  
(just my learning notes, nothing fancy)

- **TryHackMe Progress**  
  Notes from rooms I do. Mostly networking and beginner Blue Team stuff.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Notes**  
  Me trying to understand attacker techniques in simple words.

- **Linux & Networking Notes**  
  Commands, reminders, and things I need to revisit often.

## 🔹 Skills I’m Slowly Building

Not an expert in any of these yet, but trying:

- Blue Team basics  
- SIEM fundamentals  
- Linux  
- Python (just simple scripts for now)  
- Log analysis  
- MITRE ATT&CK ideas  
- Networking basics

## 🔹 Why Cybersecurity?

I’ve always liked figuring out how things work… and how they break.  
Cybersecurity feels like a mix of curiosity, logic, and a bit of chaos — and I kinda like that.  
Still learning a lot, still confused sometimes, but it’s interesting enough to keep me going.
